  - Goodmorning Sir! Are you looking for adventures?
  - If this is the case, you should prepare yourself for the dangers of the valley!
  - My friends and I found a sword stuck in a log nearby
  - You can take it if you want, we are not strong enough to extract it ...
  - Also nearby should be the shield of a knight who has had an unfortunate encounter
    with the skeletons!
